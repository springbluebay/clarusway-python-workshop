# Hands-on Flask-02 : Handling Routes and Templates with Flask Web Application

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give the students introductory knowledge of how to handle routes and use html templates within a Flask web application on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance. 

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the hands-on training, students will be able to;

- install Python and Flask framework on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance

- build a simple web application with Flask framework.

- understand the HTTP request-response cycle and structure of URL.

- create routes (or views) with Flask.

- serve static content and files using Flask.

- serve dynamic content using the html templates.

- write html templates using Jinja Templating Engine.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Getting to know routing and HTTP URLs.

- Part 2 - Install Python and Flask framework Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance 

- Part 3 - Write a Web Application with Sample Routings and Templating on GitHub Repo

- Part 4 - Run the Web App on EC2 Instance

## Part 1 - Getting to know routing and HTTP URLs.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a request-response protocol. A client on one side (web browser) asks or requests something from a server and the server on the other side sends a response to that client. When we open our browser and write down the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), we are requesting a resource from a server and the URL is the address of that resource. The structure of typical URL is as the following.

The server responds to that request with an HTTP response message. Within the response, a status code element is a 3-digit integer defines the category of response as shown below.

- 1xx -> Informational

- 2xx -> Success

- 3xx -> Redirection

- 4xx -> Client Error

- 5xx -> Server Error

## Part 2 - Install Python and Flask framework Amazon Linux 2 EC2 Instance 

- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH (Port 22) and HTTP (Port 80) connections.

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

- Install `Python 3` packages.

- Check the python3 version

- Install `Python 3 Flask` framework.

- Check the versions of Flask framework packages (flask, click, itsdangerous, jinja2, markupSafe, werkzeug)

## Part 3 - Write a Web Application with Sample Routings and Templating on GitHub Repo

- Create folder named `flask-02-handling-routes-and-templates-on-ec2-linux2` within `clarusway-python-workshop` repo

- Create python file named `app.py`

- Write an application with routing and templating samples and save the complete code under `hands-on/flask-02-handling-routes-and-templates-on-ec2-linux2` folder.

```python
# Import Flask modules
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, render_template

# Create an object named app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Create a function named home which returns a string 'This is home page for no path, <h1> Welcome Home</h1>'
# and assign route of no path ('/')
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'This is home page for no path, <h1> Welcome Home</h1>'

# Create a function named `about` which returns a formatted string '<h1>This is my about page </h1>'
# and assign to the static route of ('about')
@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return '<h1>This is my about page </h1>'

# Create a function named error which returns a formatted string '<h1>Either you encountered an error or you are not authorized.</h1>'
# and assign to the static route of ('error')
@app.route('/error')
def error():
    return '<h1>Either you encountered an error or you are not authorized.</h1>'

# Create a function named hello which returns a string of '<h1>Hello, World! </h1>'
# and assign to the static route of ('/hello')
@app.route('/hello')
def hello():
    return '<h1>Hello, World! </h1>'

# Create a function named admin which redirect the request to the error path
# and assign to the route of ('/admin')
@app.route('/admin')
def admin():
    return redirect(url_for('error'))


# Create a function named greet which return formatted inline html string
# and assign to the dynamic route of ('/<name>')
# @app.route('/<name>')
# def greet(name):
#     greet_format = f"""
# <!DOCTYPE html>
# <html>
# <head>
#     <title>Greeting Page</title>
# </head>
# <body>
#     <h1>Hello, { name }!</h1>
#     <h1>Welcome to my Greeting Page</h1>
# </body>
# </html>
#     """
#     return greet_format

# Create a function named greet_admin which redirect the request to the hello path with param of 'Master Admin!!!!'
# and assign to the route of ('/greet-admin')
@app.route('/greet-admin')
def greet_admin():
    return redirect(url_for('greet', name='Master Admin!!!'))

# Rewrite a function named greet which which uses template file named `greet.html` under `templates` folder
# and assign to the dynamic route of ('/<name>')
@app.route('/<username>')
def greet(username):
    return render_template('greet.html', name=username)

# Create a function named list10 which creates a list counting from 1 to 10 within `list10.html`
# and assign to the route of ('/list10')
@app.route('/list10')
def list10():
    return render_template('list10.html')

# Create a function named evens which show the even numbers from 1 to 10 within `evens.html`
# and assign to the route of ('/evens')
@app.route('/evens')
def evens():
    return render_template('evens.html')

# Add a statement to run the Flask application which can be reached from any host on port 80.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # app.run(debug=True)
    app.run('0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

- Write a template html file named `greet.html` which takes `name` as parameter under `templates` folder 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Greeting Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
    <h1>Welcome to my Greeting Page</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

- Write a template html file named `list10.html` which shows a list counting from 1 to 10 under `templates` folder 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>List 10</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Created 10 List Items</h1>
    <ul>
     {% for x in range(1,11) %}
        <li>List item {{ x }} </li>
     {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

- Write a template html file named `evens.html` which shows a list of even numbers from 1 to 10 under `templates` folder 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>List Evens</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Showing Even Number from 1 to 10</h1>
    <ul>
     {% for x in range(1,11) %}
        {% if x % 2 == 0 %}
        <li>Number {{ x }} is even</li>
        {% endif %}
     {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

- Create a folder named `static` under `hands-on/flask-02-handling-routes-and-templates-on-ec2-linux2` folder and create a text file named `mytext.txt` with *This is a text file in static folder* content.

- Add and commit all changes on local repo

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'added flask 02 hands-on'
```

- Push `app.py`, `greet.html`, `list10.html`, `evens.html`, and `mytext.txt` to remote repo `clarusway-python-workshop` on GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

## Part 4 - Run the Hello World App on EC2 Instance

- Download the web application file from GitHub repo.

- Run the web application

- Connect the route handling and templating web application from the web browser and try every routes configured

- Open the static file `mytext.txt` context from the web browser

- Connect the route handling and templating web application from the terminal with `curl` command.
